# To Do List - Ivy

_Made by Dani Del Rio, 24 August 2021_

This is a very simple to-do list website, made on the MERN stack. The components mostly used `react-bootstrap`, 
while the backend mainly utilized the `mongoose` library to map the schema to the MongoDB database.

## Running the App
### Backend
Run the following commands to install the packages and run the Node server. Make sure to `cd` into the `mern-exam` folder first after cloning.
```
cd backend
yarn
yarn start
```

These commands will then run the Node server on **localhost:5000**.

### Frontend
Run the following commands to install the frontend packages and run the React app. Make sure to `cd` into the `mern-exam` folder first after cloning.
```
cd frontend
yarn
yarn start
```

These commands will then run the React app on **localhost:3000**.

## Scope of the App
After following the steps above, you should be able to access the frontend on localhost:3000. Note that the to-do list application is only limited to:
- Creating and Reading To-Do Lists
- Creating and Reading Tasks under To-Do Lists
- Marking a task as complete/incomplete

Feel free to add lists/tasks and mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
